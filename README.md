## Dealing with the VM migration process by the use of a multi-agent system. ##

This project is a Master thesis.

The aim of this project is to efficiently use the decentralised approach - without a central coordinator - to deal with the VM management issue.
A technique to deal with the VM migration is to use a multi-agent or agent-based system. 
In order to achieve that, an agent based system has been implemented in which each agent plays the role of the physical machine (PM).

The monitoring and migration of VMs takes place in a simulated large-scale data centre.
Simulated environment has been chosen because large-scale data centres are not easily created for running experiments for scientific reasons. 
As such, CloudSim has been chosen as a complex simulator to be used

After implemention the experiments were held to evaluate proper functionality and effectiveness along with the performance of the system to reach a stable state. Stable state is determined as the state where no overloaded PMs exist.
